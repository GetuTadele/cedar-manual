## **CEDAR's Metadata Template**

In CEDAR, forms are created as what we call metadata templates, or just 'templates'. 
The templates contain individual questions—what we call fields—and collections of those 
fields called 'elements'. 
Elements can be included in other elements, so these are used to organize your template.

In this chapter we provide a basic information about CEDAR templates, including
what they contain and how they are organized.
