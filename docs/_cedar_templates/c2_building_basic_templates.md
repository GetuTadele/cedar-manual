In this chapter, we will provide the reader with a basic understanding on how to create different template resources (i.e., Field, Element, and Template) within the CEDAR workbench. These resources can then be shared with other users, published on the Web as JSON-LD, or can be reused within other resources (e.g., reusing an Element resource within a Template resource).
