CEDAR contains nearly 60,000 Common Data Elements imported from the National Cancer Institute'section caDSR Data Element repository. These are represented as Fields in CEDAR, as each CDE
describes a single question and its possible answers.

Because all of these CDEs were built following the same model, we offer some tips for 
working with them efficiently in the CEDAR system.

## **Finding and Browsing CDEs** 

### From the CEDAR Desktop

### When Creating a Template
