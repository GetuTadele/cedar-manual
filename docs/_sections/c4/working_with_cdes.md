CEDAR contains nearly 60,000 Common Data Elements imported from the National Cancer Institute'section caDSR Data Element repository. These are represented as Fields in CEDAR, as each CDE
describes a single question and its possible answers.

Because all of these CDEs are managed by caDSR following the same metadata model, we can offer some tips for working with them efficiently in the CEDAR system.

## **Finding and Browsing CDEs** 

### Searching from the CEDAR Desktop

### Browsing All CDEs

### Using CDE Categories

### When Creating a Template

## **Obtaining and Maintaining CDEs**
