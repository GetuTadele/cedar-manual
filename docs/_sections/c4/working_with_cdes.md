CEDAR contains nearly 60,000 Common Data Elements imported from the National Cancer Institute'section caDSR Data Element repository. These are represented as Fields in CEDAR, as each CDE
describes a single question and its possible answers.

Because all of these CDEs are managed by caDSR following the same metadata model, we can offer some tips for working with them efficiently in the CEDAR system.

## **Finding and Browsing CDEs** 

### Searching from the CEDAR Desktop

### Browsing All CDEs

If you search on "CDE" from the Desktop, one of the first entries you'll see is the CDE folder.
This is the location of all the imported CDEs from caDSR.

You will quickly discover that navigating through this list isn't practical, as only a small 
number can be presented at any one time. Instead, use the search bar to narrow down the list, 
as described above.

### Browsing by CDE Categories

In caDSR, CDEs and forms can be classified using Classifications, more specifically 
Classification Schemes and Classification Scheme Item. The caDSR classifications have been
imported into CEDAR as hierarchical categories, as shown in the image on the right. 
![](https://github.com/metadatacenter/cedar-manual/raw/master/docs/assets/imgs/category-dropdown-20191212.png){:width="20%" class="right"}

You can find CDEs in a particular category by using the CEDAR categories menu 
in the left-hand navigation panel. Selecting an item at any level of the category
hierarchy will show all the CDEs contained within that level, and all lower levels.

You can view the Category or Categories for any CDE you see in the Desktop by clicking on
the CDE, [bringing up the information metadata tab](https://metadatacenter.github.io/cedar-manual/cedar_templates/basic_topics/a3_viewing_resource_metadatda/), and selecting the Categories tab.
CEDAR lists all the Categories to which the selected CDE belongs.
