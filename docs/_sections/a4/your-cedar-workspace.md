After you first log in to CEDAR, you will be in your own workspace, which will look something like the annotated screenshot below. 
(Your workspace will not include any of the resources in the middle of this diagram.)

We will walk you through the content of this screenshot using the letters in the yellow circles.

A. The search bar lets you find other CEDAR resources. 
B. The location string tells you the local folder for this display. If it is not present, you are in a search display.
