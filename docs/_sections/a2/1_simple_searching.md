*To learn about simple navigation in the Desktop, visit [Navigating Within CEDAR](https://metadatacenter.github.io/cedar-manual/sections/a4/navigating_within_cedar/).*

The CEDAR Workbench organizes resources in three different sets, depending on the ownership and sharing: 1) resources created by the logged-in user and are listed under the "Workspace" tab, 2) resources shared with the logged-in user, and 3) public resources that are shared with every user. 

Searching for a resource in a particular set is vey simple. Just click on the given set (e.g., "Shared with everybody") and input the search string as free text (e.g., "Antibody") using the Search bar provided in the navigation header of the CEDAR Workbench. All the resources in a given set that have the string "Antibody" listed in their labels, version, or description are showcased to the logged-in user. 

TIP: Since most fields that are Common Data Elements (CDEs) have versions that end in '0.0', that can be a quick way to find CDEs that match your needs.

This process is indicated in the Figure below. In later sections, we will demonstrate how to organize and constrain these search results, and perform advanced searches.
