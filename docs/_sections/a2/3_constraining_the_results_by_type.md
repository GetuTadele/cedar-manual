title: Constraining the Results by Type

By default, when the user searches for resources (e.g., all resources that mention "Antibody"), all resources are presented to the user irrelevant of their type (i.e., field, element, template, or metadata instance). As the user (i.e., template publisher or the metadata creator) starts creating several of these resources, or has shared access to several of these resources, the total number of resources retrieved for a given search query becomes very large for intuitive navigation. 

While we paginate the search results, the user can further constrain the search results by filtering them according to the type of the resources. To set a type filter, simply click on the desirable icons indicated in the left side-bar of the CEDAR workbench (as highlighted in the Figure below). These icons are listed as Template, Element, Field, and Metadata, from left to right. The corresponding type represented by the icon can also be displayed by hovering over the icon. On selection, the icon is 'whitened-out' (i.e. displayed in white) and the resources for the corresponding type are NOT displayed in the search results (e.g., Field resources are not shown in the search results in the Figure below). To revert back (i.e., to show the Field resources), the user simply has to click on the corresponding icon again.
