By default, when the user searches for resources (for example, all resources that mention "Antibody"), by default all types of matching resources are presented to the user, including folders, templates, elements, fields, and metadata instances. If the user has access to many of these resources, intuitive navigation may become difficult. 

The user can constrain the search results by resource type using the type filter. To set a type filter, simply click on the  icons indicated in the left side-bar of the CEDAR Workbench, as highlighted in the figure below. These icons are listed as Template, Element, Field, and Metadata, from left to right. The corresponding type represented by the icon can also be displayed by hovering over the icon. On selection, the icon is displayed as a white icon, and the resources for the corresponding type are NOT displayed in the search results (for example, Field resources are not shown in the search results in the figure below). To revert back (that is, to show the Field resources), the user simply has to click on the corresponding icon again to make its dominant color green.

There is no way to disable the folder resource, as it is used to navigate to lower levels of content.

These settings also apply to any other view of resources in the Workspace window, for example in the user's home directory. Note the settings persist from one session to the next, as long as the user stays logged in, so subsequent searches will have the same resource type constraints.
