Fields can be added in two ways: by importing a stand-alone Field (created separately),
or by adding a field within an Element resource or a Template resource.  
(We refer to stand-alone CEDAR Fields throughout this User Guide with a capital 'F',
and will refer to field descriptions within templating artifacts with a lower-case 'f'.)

We start this section by describing how a field is created within a Template, 
then describe how a stand-alone CEDAR Field can be created, and finally
how a Field can be found and included in a Template.

## **Creating Field Content**

While specifying a field in a Template resource, 
you can customize the Field resource in a number of ways,
including constraining the values that metadata creators can input 
enter their metadata for this field. 

Some customizations apply to almost every field type; 
others are only allowed for one or two field types.

## **Creating a Stand-Alone Field**

This process begins by creating the Field artifact, 
almost exactly like creating the Template Artifact in <a href="">First Steps</a>. 
After that, the content of the field is created exactly as is performed 
in the Creating Field Content subsection above.

To create a new stand-alone Field, 
click the "New" button on the Desktop's navigation sidebar
(upper left of the Workspace view) and
select the "Field" option in the dropdown menu. 
This step opens up the Field creation form as shown below. 

Enter the human-readable label, identifier and description of the Field  
using the three text input fields ('Untitled', 'Identifier', 'Description') 
underlined in the image below.
