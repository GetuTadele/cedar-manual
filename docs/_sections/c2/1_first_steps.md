The preliminary step for the creation of a CEDAR Template resource is the provision of a human-readable label, a unique identifier, and a description of what the Template resource represents (e.g., a template for entering Injury-related metadata). After clicking the "New" button on the naviation sidebar, select the "Template" option in the dropdown menu. This step opens up the resource creation form as shown in the Figure below. Enter the human-readable lable, identifier and description of the Template resource using the text input fields highlighted below. 

In the next steps, we will populate this "Injury" Template resource with different Field and Element resources.
