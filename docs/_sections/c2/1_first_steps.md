In the first steps to create a CEDAR Metadata Template resource, 
you will provide a human-readable label, a unique identifier, 
and a description of what the Template resource represents (e.g., "Injury-related treatment tracking"). 

To create a new template, first click the "New" button on the Desktop's navigation sidebar
(upper left of the Workspace view) and
select the "Template" option in the dropdown menu. 
This step opens up the resource creation form as shown below. 

Enter the human-readable label, identifier and description of the Template resource 
using the three text input fields ('Untitled', 'Identifier', 'Description') 
underlined in the image below.

In the next steps, we will populate an "Injury" Template resource with different Field and Element resources. 

## **Useful Content Tips**

By default CEDAR searches look at the Label, Identifier, and Description field for matches,
so consider what terms will be most important to include for searches to find your template. 

**Label** The label of the template should fit easily into the Workspace view if possible, 
allowing for CEDAR to append 'metadata' to the label to create names of the metadata instances. 
(Figure about 40-50 characters for your label.)

You don't need to append Template or Form to the end of the label; 
this will be clear from context.

**Identifier** You do not have to create an identifier; 
typically you will leave this field blank. 
The field is provided for users
who want to identify an external entity associated with this template. 
It works best when unique references to external identifiers can be automatically assigned.

**Description** This description can be any length; 
a sentence or short paragraph is common. 
Describe the subject that the template is documenting; 
we already know this is a CEDAR template, 
so you don't have to include that.  
Of course we also know it describes metadata, 
but "Metadata describing â€¦" often seems to be a useful context to set up your description.

Because Description is a longer field, it is a good place to include key words or other
information you want to be able to search on to find this field.
