The preliminary step for the creation of a CEDAR Metadata Template resource is the provision of a human-readable label, a unique identifier, and a description of what the Template resource represents (e.g., "Injury-related treatment tracking"). 

To create a new template, first click the "New" button on the Desktop's navigation sidebar, select the "Template" option in the dropdown menu. This step opens up the resource creation form as shown in the Figure below. Enter the human-readable label, identifier and description of the Template resource using the text input fields highlighted below. 

<!-- TODO: Screenshot -->

In the next steps, we will populate this "Injury" Template resource with different Field and Element resources.
