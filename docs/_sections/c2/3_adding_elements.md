An Element resource is composed of several different Field resources as well as other Element resources. The idea behind the creation of these Element resources is to enable different Template creators to share, reuse, and extend existing Element resources across different Template resources as well as different user groups. This section is divided into two different parts: 1) we will take a detour and create a new Element resource, and 2) we will embed the newly created Element resource within our Template resource. 

### Creating a new Element resource
To create a new Element resource, return outside the Template editor view and back to the CEDAR Workbench (i.e., use the "Back" button in the Template editor view -- you may be prompted to save the Template you are currently editing). Click on the "New" button in the navigation sidebar of the CEDAR Workbench, and select "Element" from the dropdown menu this time. This action will launch the Element editor view as shown in the Figure below. We will create a new Element resource in our example called "Address". Similar to the creation of the Template resource (covered in the previous section), we will provide a human-readable label, an identifier, and a description for the Element resource. 

The "Address" element will have the following text Field resources: 1) Add
