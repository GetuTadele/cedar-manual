All of these are stored internally in the JSON Schema format, 
which CEDAR lets you view at any time during template creation.

The CEDAR template serves three purposes:
- define the template questions (including their possible answers and other features),
- document the order in which the questions and elements will appear; and
- describe the template artifact: its name, provenance including creation and update times,
and other characteristics. 
These are broadly organized in three sections of the template, 
which is described in more detail in the [CEDAR Template Model](https://metadatacenter.org/tools-training/outreach/cedar-template-model).
