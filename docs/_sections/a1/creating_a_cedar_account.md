The first step to create metadata templates and metadata with the CEDAR workbench is to create a CEDAR workbench user account. To do this, visit [https://cedar.metadatacenter.org](https://cedar.metadatacenter.org "CEDAR Workbench") and click on the "Register" link below the Password line. Enter your first name, last name, a functional email address, and a password as shown in the screenshot below. After clicking on register, check your email address for a link to validate your user account. After validation you can easily log in to the CEDAR workbench as indicated in the next section.
