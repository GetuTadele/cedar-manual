The first step to create metadata templates and metadata with the CEDAR workbench is to create a CEDAR workbench user account. To do this, visit [https://cedar.metadatacenter.org](https://cedar.metadatacenter.org "CEDAR Workbench") and click on the "Register" link below the Password line. 

In the next window, enter your first name, last name, a functional email address, 
and a password as shown in the screenshot below. You should make the first name and last name 
what you want to appear on your user folder. 
(If you are creating a second account, be sure to make the first name/last name 
combination for that account different than it was for your first account,
so you can tell them apart in CEDAR.) 

After clicking on the `REGISTER` button, check your email (at the address you provided) 
for a link to validate your user account. 
Click on the link to complete the account creation process. 
After validation you can easily log in to the CEDAR workbench as indicated in the next section.
