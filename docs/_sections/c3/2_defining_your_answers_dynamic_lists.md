chapter_title: More FAIR Templates Using Semantics
---

In this section, we want to show you how to create questions 
that have very precise answers, using CEDAR's semantic tools.
You don't have to know semantics to use these toolsâ€”
we'll give you some tips (in [Choosing Controlled Terms](https://metadatacenter.github.io/cedar-manual/sections/c3/3_choosing_controlled_terms/) that help you find good answers
and know they are good enough for your needs.
For you semantic experts, we provide advanced details in elsewhere in this User Manual:

* [Tips for Template Creation: Term Discovery/Selection](https://metadatacenter.github.io/cedar-manual/sections/c5/term_discovery_selection/)
* [Advanced Template Topics:More Semantics](https://metadatacenter.github.io/cedar-manual/sections/c4/more_semantics/)

In this section we'll outline the mechanical steps to find, select, and even create terms. 
The next section will tell how to figure out which terms are good ones to use.

All the following sub-sections assume you have created a basic text field, 
clicked on the Values tab for your field,
and clicked on the Add button to bring up the term search dialog box, 
as described in [Adding Fields](https://metadatacenter.github.io/cedar-manual/sections/c2/2_adding_fields/).
