## **Basic Steps**

When the metadata instance opens, you can click in any field to start adding metadata.

To move to the next field, you can hit return (once or twice depending on the field type). In a few cases you may have to click in the next field. 

In some cases (see the image below), the metadata instance may show elements as an outline, with their content hidden. To view and fill out metadata fields within those elements, click on the element header to show the element's contents.

Your metadata is not saved until you hit the SAVE button, visible in the image above. 
You may have to scroll to the end of a long template to see the Save button in the lower right corner. We recommend you save your metadata often, so that little is lost if your browser window is accidentally closed. See [Saving and Validating](https://metadatacenter.github.io/cedar-manual/sections/a5/3_saving_and_validating/) for more details.

## **Viewing JSON-LD and RDF**

You can see the JSON-LD and RDF versions of your metadata by clicking on the appropriate controls at the bottom of your metadata instance. For more information see [Viewing Resource as Raw JSON](https://metadatacenter.github.io/cedar-manual/sections/a3/4_viewing_resource_as_raw_json/).

## **Multiple Elements**

Most of the field types can be enabled as "multiple" fields by the template creator. 
If a field is set to multiple, you will see controls that let you add additional
values.

You can click on the Copy icon to create another instance of the field that is a copy of the first. This results in a second field (right image), into which you can put the desired value for that field.

The numbers shown in the right-hand multiple fields controls let the user navigate to any particular field in the list of fields.

In many cases the field values can be viewed and edited in an array, using the Format icon (that shows a 3-item list). This results in the following display.

If you click on the format icon again (now shown as two opposed arrows), you will return to the list view. Any changes made will be reflected

## **Advanced Steps**

For certain types of metadata, some tips may be useful.

### Multiple free-text fields


### Drop-down fields


### Attribute-value fields
