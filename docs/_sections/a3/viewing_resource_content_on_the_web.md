We use the phrase 'viewing resource content' to mean looking at the resource in human-friendly form, either in the CEDAR application or on the web using OpenView.



You will be shown a viewing window that lets you navigate throughout the artifact,
open and close sections of metadata instances, and if you have write permission,
make changes to the document. 

This is also the view which enables seeing the raw artifact content inside CEDAR.
