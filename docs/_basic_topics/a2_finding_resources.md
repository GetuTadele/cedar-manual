This second chapter in the CEDAR manual provides a basic understanding on how to find different resources (i.e., any of template, element, field, instance, folder, user, group (CEDAR REST resources) in the CEDAR Workspace: those resources that are created by me, those resources that are shared with me, and those resources that are shared with everybody.
