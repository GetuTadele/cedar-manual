This second chapter in the CEDAR manual provides a basic understanding on how to find different resources (i.e., any of template, element, field, instance, folder) in the CEDAR Workbench: those resources that are created by me, those resources that are shared with me, and those resources that are shared with everybody. The reader will also get a brief overview on how to filter and sort the retrieved results and formulate advanced queries.
